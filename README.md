# Java OOP and GUI Projects

A **personal portfolio collection** of Java applications showcasing **advanced object-oriented programming** (OOP) principles, **graphical user interfaces** (GUI), and **real-world design patterns**.

This repository demonstrates my ability to build **modular, maintainable, and user-friendly** Java desktop applications using **Swing**, **Java2D**, and **embedded database integration**.

## Projects Included

### 1. Customer Loan Accounts

A console-based Java application modeling a **bank loan management system** with:

- Rich class hierarchy with inheritance and polymorphism
- Composition (Customer owns multiple LoanAccounts)
- Abstract base classes and specialized subclasses (CarLoan, PrimaryMortgage, UnsecuredLoan)
- Clean separation of concerns with reusable, modular classes

**Skills demonstrated:**  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Composition  
- Abstraction  
- Clean, modular design

### 2. Java 2D Drawing App

A **Swing-based GUI application** allowing users to draw:

- Lines
- Rectangles (filled/unfilled)
- Ovals (filled/unfilled)

Features:

- Custom JFrame window and Java2D rendering
- Encapsulated Shape hierarchy using inheritance and polymorphism
- User interaction for creating and customizing shapes

**Skills demonstrated:**  
- GUI development with Swing  
- Java2D rendering
